The treating of an adversary with fierceness, anger, or disdain; the representing his opinions in the worst light; and especially the inveighing against the blasphemes or absurdities which we think flow from his schemes, as if they were really part of them, and adopted by him; instead of doing any good, tend equally to disgrace the writer, and the disadvantage of his cause.
