King Henry the Fourth (of France) asked the Duke of Alva if he had observed the
great eclipse of the sun, which had lately happened. No, said the duke, I have so much
to do on earth, that I have no leisure to look up to heaven. All, that this were not
true of most [professing Christians] in these days! It is very sad to think, how their
hearts and time is so much taken up with earthly things, that they have scarce any
leisure to look up to heaven, or to look after Christ, and the things that belong to
their everlasting peace.
