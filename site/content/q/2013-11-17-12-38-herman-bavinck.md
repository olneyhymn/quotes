title: Freedom to Go to the Throne of Grace
---
When our faith is weak, when we lapse into sin, believers always have the right and the freedom to go with confidence to the throne of grace and plead on the basis of the faithfulness of him whose gift of grace and calling are irrevocable. Believers do not pray out of doubt and despair; they do not pray as though they are no longer children of God and again face eternal damnation; they pray from within the faith as children to the Father who is in heaven, and says Amen to their prayer.
