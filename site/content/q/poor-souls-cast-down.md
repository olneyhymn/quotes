What is the great reason that so many poor souls are so much cast down for sin, too much dejected under the sight and sense of it?

It is this: because they are afraid to cast themselves wholly upon Jesus Christ, and to roll themselves upon him for salvation.

Though more sin requires more tears upon the thoughts of it, yet Jesus Christ need not shed more blood for sin; Jesus Christ needs no more to die for the satisfaction for sin; Christ hath paid a full and complete and sufficient ransom for sin, and needs die no more.
