How it is possible that one who is in reality distinguished above others can reckon those to be superior to him who he knows are greatly beneath him?  

Let him... employ himself in correcting and detecting his faults, and he will have abundant occasion for humility. 

In others, on the other hand, he will regard with honor whatever there is of excellences, and will by means of love bury their faults.
