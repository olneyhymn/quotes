You say, 'If they be sincere, and fail not for want of diligence and searching, I cannot help thinking that God will not condemn them for an inevitable defect in their understanding.' Indeed, my friend, I have such a low opinion of man and his depraved state, that I believe no one has real sincerity in religious matters till God bestows it.
