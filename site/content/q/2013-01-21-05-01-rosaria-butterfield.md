At least as it regard the handful of families that showed immediate excitement and then after a month changed heart, this is what 'lacking fellowship'; means. It means that the family needs a church made up of people who are just like they, who raise their children using the same childrearing methods, who take the same stance on birth control, schooling, voting, breastfeeding, dress codes, white flour, white sugar, gluten, childhood immunizations, the observance of secular and religious holidays.
