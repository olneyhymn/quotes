title: George Ladd on the Kingdom of God
---

The Kingdom of God is a miracle. It is the act of God. It is supernatural. Men cannot build the Kingdom; they cannot erect it. The Kingdom of God is the Kingdom of God; it is God’s reign, God’s rule. God has entrusted the Gospel of the Kingdom to men. It is our responsibility to proclaim the good news about the Kingdom. But the actual working of the Kingdom is God’s working.
