This verb is often used to describe the hostile actions of enemies. One might expect the psalmist’s enemies to chase him, but ironically God’s 'goodness and faithfulness' pursue him instead. The word 'pursue' is used outside of its normal context in an ironic manner and creates a unique, but pleasant word picture of God’s favor (or a kind God) 'chasing down' the one whom he loves.
