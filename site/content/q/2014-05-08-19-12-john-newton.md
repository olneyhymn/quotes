It is an astonishing thought, that God should thus dwell with men; that he, before whom the mightiest earthly potentates are less than nothing and vanity, should thus stoop and accommodate himself to the situation, wants, and capacities of the weakest, meanest, and poorest of his children. But so it hath pleased him. He seeth not as man seeth.
