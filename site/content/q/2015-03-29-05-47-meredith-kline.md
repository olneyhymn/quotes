title: Baptism-Curcifixion

At the exodus these judgment waters performed both functions, destroying the Egyptian army but delivering the chosen, priestly nation of Israel. Paul identified these judicial waters of the exodus as a baptism (1 Cor 10:2) reflecting the fact that baptism symbolizes the undergoing of a judgment ordeal.

The waters of baptism are a death passage with forensic significance. Thus, for those who by faith undergo baptismal death in Christ's baptism-crucifixion, baptism is unto the remission of sins."
