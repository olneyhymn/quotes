For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function, so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. (Romans 12)

For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. ... If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together. (1 Corinthians 12)

Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. (Ephesians 4)

Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind.
