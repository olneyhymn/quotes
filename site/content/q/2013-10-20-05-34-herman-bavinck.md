The gnostic and Marcionite disjunction between the Old Testament God of wrath and vengeance and the New Testament God of love and mercy is unknown to Scripture. Yahweh Elohim in the Old Testament, though just, holy, zealous for his honor, and full of ire against sin, is also gracious, merciful, eager to forgive, and abounding in steadfast love.
