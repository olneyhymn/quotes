A holy, well-governed family is the preparative to a holy and well-governed church.

If masters of families did their part, and sent such polished materials to the churches, as they ought to do, the work and life of the pastors of the church would be unspeakably more easy and delightful.

It would do one good to preach to such an auditory, to catechize them, and instruct him, and examine them, and watch over them, who are prepared by wise and holy education, and understand and love the doctrine which they hear.
