title: If God Were Indeed a Human Projection
---

If 'God' were indeed a human projection or creation, a human effort to explain reality now known to us via science, or a means of providing security, comfort, and benefits now available to us through technological mastery, then indeed religion would wither away. But if God is real and religion is inevitable for us as human beings, then religion remains. It has, and it will.
