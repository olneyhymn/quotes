Our resentment is against the timetable which the sovereign God has assigned us, a schedule based on a plan of which we are usually ignorant. It is this ignorance which brings about our frustration, the seeming senselessness of delay, loss, or failure. But this is the reason why impatience is such a noxious weedâ€”it leaves God out of our thinking.
