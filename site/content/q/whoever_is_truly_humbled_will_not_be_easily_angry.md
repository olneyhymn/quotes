Whoever is truly humbled will not be easily angry, will not be positive and easy, will be compassionate and tender to the infirmities of his fellow sinners, know that if there be a difference it is grace that has made it, and that he has the seeds of every evil in his own heart. 

And under all trials and afflictions, he will look to the hand of the Lord, and lay his mouth in the dust, acknowledging that he suffers much less than his iniquities deserve. 

These are some of the advantages and good fruits which the Lord enables us to obtain from that bitter root, in dwelling sin.
