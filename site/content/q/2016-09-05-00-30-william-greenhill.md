Six ways that we can use God’s creation well and right.

1. Use all things for the end that God has made them [for the glory of God].
2. Walk with God in the use of the world and answer God’s call.
3. Use the things of the world to promote spiritual good in ourselves and others.
4. Use the world slightly and consider the things of God and of my soul as my main business.
5. Use the world in moderation, keeping your affections in check.
6. Give a good and cheerful account to God concerning what we have had in the world.
