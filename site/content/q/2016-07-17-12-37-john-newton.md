Happy is that family where the worship of God is constantly and conscientiously maintained. 

Such houses are temples, in which the Lord dwells, and castles garrisoned by a Divine power. 

I do not say, that by honouring God in your house, you will wholly escape a share in the trials incident to the present uncertain state of things. A measure of such trials will be necessary for the exercise and manifestation of your graces, to give you a more convincing proof of the truth and sweetness of the promises made to a time of affliction, to mortify the body of sin, and to wean you more effectually from the world. But this I will confidently say, that the Lord will both honour and comfort those who honour him.
