Bogardus was ill-suited to adjust to the poor decisions of the colony's leadership. He and one of New Netherland's governors, Wouter van Twiller, carried on a heated dispute in which the pastor called the governor a 'child of the Devil, an incarnate villain,' and in retaliation the governor drew his sword and chased Bogardus through the streets of New Amsterdam.
