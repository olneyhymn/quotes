I long to be able to use Job's words, with the same feeling as I believe Job had when he spoke them, Behold, I am vile! The acknowledgment in words is quite easy — but really and in good earnest to abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes — is most difficult. I know that I ought to be humbled before Him — but I want to be so indeed.

But that monster SELF has as many heads as a Hydra — and as many lives as a cat!
