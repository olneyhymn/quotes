The glory of Christ is also seen in the stability and security that is given to the whole new creation. The first creation was glorious. Everything depended on God under a covenant of obedience. Everything was brought down by the sin of angels and men. But now everything that belongs to this new creation, including every believer in the world, as well as the angels in heaven, being gathered together under this one head, are all infallibly kept from ever being ruined by sin again. In this new head all is 'established, strengthened and settled', and that for ever.
