title: Is He Not Gracious and Faithful?
---

Let us suppose the thing we are most afraid of actually to happen. Can it come a moment sooner, or in any other way, than by His appointment? 

Is He not gracious, and faithful, to support us under the stroke? 

Is He not rich enough to give us something better than ever He will take away? 

Is not the light of His countenance better than life and all its most valued enjoyments?
