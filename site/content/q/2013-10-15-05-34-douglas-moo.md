Holiness of life, then, is achieved neither by our own unaided effort -- the error of 'moralism' or 'legalism' -- nor by the Spirit apart from our participation -- as some who insist that the key to holy living is 'surrender' or 'let go and let God' would have it -- but by our constant living out of the 'life' placed within us by the Spirit who has taken up residence within.
