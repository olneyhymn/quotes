Would it not be an encouragement to a subject, to hear his prince say to him, You will honor and please me very much, if you will go to yonder mine of gold, and dig as much gold for yourself as you can carry away? 

So, for God to say, Go to the ordinances [preaching, prayer, sacraments], get as much grace as you can, dig out as much salvation as you can; and the more happiness you have, the more I shall count myself glorified.
