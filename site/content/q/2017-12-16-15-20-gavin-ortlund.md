title: Christ and the Day of Atonement

For Stephen Charnock, the high priest’s activity on the Day of Atonement in Lev 16 prefigured Christ’s priestly ministry in at least three ways.

First, his sacrificing animals outside the tent was a type of Christ’s death.

Second, his entrance into the Holy of Holies was a type of Christ’s ascension to heaven.

Third, his sprinkling blood and burning incense inside the Holy of Holies was a type of Christ’s intercession, both in his presentation of his wounds to the Father (sprinkling) as well as in his pleas for the saints (incense).
