In his finished work Christ did something once for all respecting the power of sin and it is the virtue of this victory which he secured that the power of sin is broken in all those who are united to him. It is in this connection that a strand of New Testament teaching needs to be appreciated but which is frequently overlooked. 

It is that not only is Christ regarded as having died for the believer but the believer is represented as having died in Christ and is being raised up with him to newness of life.
