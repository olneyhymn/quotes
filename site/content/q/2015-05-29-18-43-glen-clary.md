Fantastic discussion with Glen Clary. 

Shiloh Presbyterian Church: reason #1 you shouldn't be late to church:

The call to worship tells us something very theologically significant. God summons us into his presence to worship him. ... We are summoned into the presence of God to join into the worship of heaven. Worship is an eschatological event. We are entering into the heavenly sanctuary.
