title: We Are Not Our Own
---

We are not our own; therefore, neither our reason nor our will should dominate our plans and actions.

We are not our own; therefore, let us not make the gratification of our flesh our end.

We are not our own; therefore, as much as possible, let us forget ourselves and our own interests.

Rather, we are Godâ€™s. Therefore, let us live and die to Him.
