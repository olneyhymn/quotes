title: Character of a Deacon
---
Animated by the spirit of his ofﬁce, and acting out the character which the counsels of the Word imply, [a deacon] will not be haughty, or harsh, or suspicions, he will not be cold, and formal, and repulsive, discharging his work as if it were a burden; he will be frank and easy in his intercourse with the poor and take an interest in their avocations, their health, and welfare; kind, and tender, and sympathising, especially when in sickness; but withal ﬁrm, and not easily persuaded to what his judgment does not approve. He will also have a deep conviction of the insufﬁciency of all his efforts to beneﬁt the poor of his charge without the blessing of God, and hence he will not fail to seek the blessing in the exercise of diligent and persevering prayer for the Holy Spirit.
