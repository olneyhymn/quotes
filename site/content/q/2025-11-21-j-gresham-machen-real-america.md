If aliens were to be called upon, at the discretion of officials, for their registration cards, citizens must be given some means of proving that they are not aliens, and so they must presumably provide themselves with registration cards, too.

And so we shall have a full-fledged European police system established almost before we know it; the American citizen will be required as he goes from place to place to "show his papers" quite in the European style.

And when that happens the real America will be dead.
