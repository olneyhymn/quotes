Jesus is mine! I'm now prepared <br />
To meet with what I thought most hard;<br />
Yes, let the winds of trouble blow,<br />
And comforts melt away like snow:<br />

No blasted trees, or failing crops,<br />
Can hinder my eternal hopes;<br />
Though creatures change, the Lord's the same;<br />
Then let me triumph in his name.<br />
