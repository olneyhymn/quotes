title: Fading is the Worldling’s Pleasure
---

Savior, if of Zion’s city<br />
  I, through grace, a member am,<br />
Let the world deride or pity—<br />
  I will glory in Thy name.<br />
Fading is the worldling’s pleasure,<br />
  All his boasted pomp and show;<br />
Solid joys and lasting treasure<br />
  None but Zion’s members know.
