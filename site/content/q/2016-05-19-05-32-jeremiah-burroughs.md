'I think I could be content with God's hand,' says one, 'so far as I see the hand of God in a thing I can be content. But when men deal so unreasonably and unjustly with me, I do not know how to bear it.'

Though they are men who bring this cross on you, yet they are God's instruments. God has a hand in it, and they can go no further than God would have them go.
