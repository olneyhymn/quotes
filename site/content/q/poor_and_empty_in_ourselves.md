title: Poor and Empty in Ourselves

His own glory is most displayed, and our safety best secured, by keeping us quite poor and empty in ourselves, and supplying us from one minute to another, according to our need. This, if any thing, will prevent our boasting, and keep a sense of gratitude awake in our hearts. This is well adapted to quicken us to prayer, and furnish us with a thousand occasions for praise, which would otherwise escape our notice.
