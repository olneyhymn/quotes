The church is required to be the body of Christ in which the unmarried may find
fulfillment as persons in the fellowship and companionship of the congregation of
believers. The church should recognize that being unmarried the single members are free
to be 'anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord' (1 Corinthians
7:32). Therefore they must be given the opportunity within the fellowship of believers
to serve the body of Christ and experience the love and acceptance of the body of the
Lord.
