---

It is strange that pride should ever find anything in my experience to feed upon; but this completes my character for folly, vileness, and inconsistence, that I'm not only poor but proud; and, though I'm convinced I am a very wretch, as nothing before the Lord, I'm prone to go forth among my fellow-creatures as though I were wise and good.
