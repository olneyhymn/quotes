title: Strain of Anabaptism in American Religion
---

It is no exaggeration to assert that there exists a decided strain of Anabaptism in American evangelicalism.

The prevalent powerful prejudice, against certain things the use of which should be left to the individual conscience, and the too strong insistence sometimes at young people's Bible conferences that they devote themselves to 'full-time' Christian service rather than engage in so-called secular vocations, are just two bits of evidence.
