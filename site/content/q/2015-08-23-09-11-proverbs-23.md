Listen to your father who gave you life,
   and do not despise your mother when she is old.
Buy truth, and do not sell it;
   buy wisdom, instruction, and understanding.
The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice;
   he who fathers a wise son will be glad in him.
Let your father and mother be glad;
   let her who bore you rejoice.
