title: Unpractical Theology?

Some may scorn the comfort and triumph of [1 Peter] as unpractical theology. His answers are answers of faith. But Peter knows that his witness is true, that Jesus Christ is real. He has tasted that the Lord is good, and that his goodness will not fail. 'This is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it' (1 Peter 5:12).
