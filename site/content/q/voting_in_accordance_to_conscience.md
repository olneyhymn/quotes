title: Voting in Accordance to Conscience
---

A great many men feel that there is no use in voting against a thing unless you can defeat it. 


I do not feel that way.

I think it is a very important thing to vote exactly in accordance with your conscience, quite irrespective of the immediate success of your vote in your dealing with that measure.
