title: A Surgeon's Skill
---

If people are satisfied of a surgeon's skill and prudence, they will not only yield to be cut at his pleasure without pretending to direct him where, or how long he shall make the incision, but will thank him and pay him for putting them in pain, because they believe it for their advantage. I wish I could be more like them and my concerns. My body, as I said is, through mercy, free from considerable ailments, but I have a soul that requires surgeon's work continually.
