title: The Old Testament Revelation of the Messiah
---

Old Testament Revelation approaches the concept of a personal Messiah very gradually. It sufficed for fallen man to know that through His divine power and grace God would bring out of the human race victory over the serpent. In that faith could rest. The object of their faith was much less definite than that of ours, who know the personal Messiah. But nonetheless, the essence of this faith, subjectively considered, was the same, viz., trust in God's grace and power to bring deliverance from sin.
