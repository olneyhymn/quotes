Yet [Paul] is not so careful about good works as to despise the root -- that is, faith -- while he is gathering the fruits. He takes account of both parts, and, as is highly proper, assigns the first rank to faith; for he enjoins those 'who believed in God' to be zealous of 'good works;' by which he means that faith must go before in such a manner that good works may follow.
