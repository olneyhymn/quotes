title: Real Victory Already Possessed
---

The church today will remain impoverished in understanding its true identity and its task in the creation, until it is grasped by the fully eschatological significance of Christ’s death and resurrection and embraces 'realized' or 'inaugurated' eschatology taught in the New Testament...

What will challenge and activate and sustain the church (and give it 'optimism') in its present calling is its perception not of a presumed promise of future dominion before Christ’s return but of the real victory it already possesses in the exalted Christ.
