According to the Bible, the church is the people of God, the assembly and body of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Each of these views of the church has been favoured in one of the major ecclesiastical heritages.

The Reformed family of churches has emphasized the church as the people of God; the sacramental churches as the body of Christ; the Anabaptist churches as the disciples of Christ; and the Pentecostal churches as the fellowship of the Spirit.

No doubt we are all guilty of tunnel vision, focusing on one model.
