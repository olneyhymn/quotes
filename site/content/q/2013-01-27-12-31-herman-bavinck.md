---

The doctrine of providence is not a philosophical system but a confession of faith that, notwithstanding appearances, only God--by his almighty and everywhere present power--preserves and governs all things. This conviction spares us from superficial optimism and presumptuous pessimism alike; we neither deny life's riddles nor wallow in despair.
