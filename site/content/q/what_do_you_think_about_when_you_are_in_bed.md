title: What do you think about when you are in bed?
---

What do you think about when you are in bed, either settling down to sleep or waking up? There are those who 'work out evil on their beds'! (Mic. 2:1). And there are those who 'sing aloud on their beds. The high praises of God are in their mouths' (Psa. 149:5-6). There are those who 'devise mischief on their beds' (Psa. 36:4). And there are those who commune with their hearts and remember God and meditate on him on their beds' (Psa. 4:4; 63:6).
