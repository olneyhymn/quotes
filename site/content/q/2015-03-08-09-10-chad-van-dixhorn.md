title: Does Your Faith Waiver?
---

Does your faith ever waver? Remember the Holy Spirit, for he too is promised in this covenant that is all of grace. The Spirit will make us ‘willing’ to believe in a crucified Saviour and ‘able to believe’ in an empty tomb—it is he who begins our salvation. And remember too that this gift is for those who are ‘ordained unto eternal life’ and nothing less. For in this second covenant, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit have offered a relationship to us that will never end.
