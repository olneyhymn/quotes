title: Mothers with a Triumphant Faith
pre: My great-grandfather Hopper, writing about his mother's reaction to his only sister's decision to join him as a Presbyterian missionary in Korea in 1922. She served until 1957.

That mother through the years had endured and won in the Christian race, who had a supreme desire and joy in having her children to bear the message glorious, wrote me these words about her daughter's decision: 'It is great to have another one of my dear ones called into the Master's service.'

Mothers with a triumphant faith like this are constantly needed that Christian witnessing may be continued 'both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.'
