Your maneuvering for power, for influence, for position, for status, for wealth, for reputation of the present is a contradiction of the eschatological nature of life in Christ. Make yourself of *some* reputation in the arena where Christ makes himself of *no* reputation? What a fool! 

Jesus must increase, and you must be nothing that He may be all-in-all. Enough of these Reformed egomaniacs! Give me servants of Jesus who are content to be of no reputation with their Lord.
