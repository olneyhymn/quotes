title: Badness of our Times

It is folly to complain of the badness of our own times when we have more reason to complain of the badness of our own hearts (if menâ€™s hearts were better, the times would mend) and when we have more reason to be thankful that they are not worse, but that even in the worst of times we enjoy many mercies, which help to make them not only tolerable, but comfortable.
