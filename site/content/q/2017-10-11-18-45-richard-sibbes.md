It would be a good contest amongst Christians, one to labour to give no offence, and the other to labour to take none.

The best men are severe to themselves, tender over others. 

Yet people should not tire and wear out the patience of others: nor should the weaker so far demand moderation from others as to rely upon their indulgence and so to rest in their own infirmities, with danger to their own souls and scandal to the church.
