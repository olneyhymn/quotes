title: Bavinck on Science and Scripture
---

Human scientific research cannot become an independent third-party arbitrator deciding what parts of Scripture, if any, are reliable and to be accepted. Those who make their doctrine of Scripture dependent on historical research into its origination and structure have already begun to reject Scripture's self-testimony and therefore no longer believe that Scripture.
