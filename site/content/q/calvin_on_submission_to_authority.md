Knowing that someone has been placed over by the Lord's ordination, we should render to him reverence, obedience, and gratefulness, and should perform such other duties for him as we can. 

It makes no difference whether our superiors are worthy or unworthy of this honor, for whatever they are they have attained their position through God's providence.
