By your Spirit destroy the wickedness of our heart, and restore us to a sound mind, that we may ever cleave to you with a true and sincere heart, that being fortified by your defense, we may continue safe even amidst all kinds of danger, until at length you gather us into that blessed rest, which has been prepared for us in heaven by our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
