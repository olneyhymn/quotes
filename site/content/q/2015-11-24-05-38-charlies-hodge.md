The apostle therefore says that if any man is in Christ he experiences a change analogous to that predicted by the prophets, and like to that which we still anticipate when earth shall become heaven.

Old opinions, views, plans, desires, principles and affections are passed away; new views of truth, principles and affections are passed away, new views of truth, new principles, new apprehensions of the destiny of man, and new feelings and purposes fill and govern the soul.
