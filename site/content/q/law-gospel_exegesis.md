Law-gospel is a wonderful theological category. It’s lousy exegesis. If every
command that you find you put in the category of law, and every promise you put in the
category of gospel, and every time you see a command you say, ‘Well the point of this
command must be, you can’t do this but Jesus has done it for you and therefore be
thankful for the justification you have in him, you are absolutely eradicating scores of
imperatives and exhortations that Paul treasures in the New Testament and things that
are deeply important for us to embrace as Christians.
