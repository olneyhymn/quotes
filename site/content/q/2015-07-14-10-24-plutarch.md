title: The Ungoverned Tongue
---

My own reading affords countless instances of the greatest disasters resulting from an ungoverned tongue. When upon the marriage of Philadelphus with his sister, Sotades composed a scurrilous verse, he paid ample atonement for talking out of season by rotting for a long time in prison. He thus purchased a laugh in others by long weeping of his own.
