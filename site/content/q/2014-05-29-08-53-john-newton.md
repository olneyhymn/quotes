title: John Newton on Jonthan Edwards

'Edwards on Free Will,' I have read with pleasure, as a good answer to proud reasoners in their own way; but a book of that sort cannot be generally read: where the subject matter is unpleasing, and the method of treating it requires more attention than the Athenian spirit of the times would bear, I wonder not if it is uncalled for.
