We must confess with shame that the deepest cause of that lack of esteem for dogma and theology that we lament in American Christianity, is a lack of self-confidence, of trust in the veracity of our God and his infallible revelation.

If we believed it, we would think more and with greater liking, and maintain the thoughts of God over against the thoughts of the world.
