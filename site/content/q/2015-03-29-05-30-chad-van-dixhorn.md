This is the promise of God's Word. In spite of our daily failings, in spite of the accusations of our enemies, [Jesus] is there to quieten our consciences, to encourage our prayers, and to accept us and our services.

He is our advocate and his very appearance in the presence of God—his scarred body in that perfect place—fully pleads our desperate case. He is able to silence our accuser, for in heaven it is a known fact that 'there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.'
