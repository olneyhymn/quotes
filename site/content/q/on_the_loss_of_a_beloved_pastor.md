Your beloved pastor has died, but he has only gone a little before you. We expect and hope to follow him soon. It will be a joyful meeting, when we shall part no more. In the mean time, you will do well to consider that he neither did nor could do you any good but as an instrument, and that his Lord and Master who honored him with acceptance and usefulness still lives, and the supply of the Spirit is still with him. What must the first disciples have felt--when their Master was not only taken from them--but crucified before their eyes? Yet He had said to them a little before, "But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you." John 16:7. Surely that Comforter, whose influence was more than a compensation for the lack of the Savior's visible presence--can fully repair our losses and heal our wounds. And He is as near to his people now, and as willing and able to help them--as He was then.  


The fountain from which your dear pastor obtained the water of life, which he communicated to his congregation--is still full and still flowing; and you are still welcome to come to Him and drink! But we are prone to lean too hard upon the ministers, by whom the Lord conveys His blessings to us--as if they were necessary. Perhaps to cure us of this mistake, is one reason why He often unexpectedly takes them from us!  


I have been at Reading in spirit almost continually since I first heard the sad news. I was particularly with you on Sunday last. Methought I saw many tears shed and heard many sighs at St. Giles. I did not blame you. Your loss is great. The first emotions of grief were unavoidable, and He who knows our frame allows us that these things for the present are "not joyous but grievous." But neither shall I commend you if you indulge a continuance and excess of grief. Now that the Lord has made known his will by the event--our part is submission. I pray that you may be willing to be helped, and then I am sure He will help you. *Say not, "What shall we do?" The Lord has many resources--when ours seem wholly to fail.*  


I remember when my friend, Mr. Talbot died (The predecessor of Mr. Cadogan at St. Giles); those who loved him too much, thought the glory was departed from Reading. They knew not that his successor, whom they at first disliked, was appointed and sent to show them still greater things. I doubt not but every proper step will be taken to obtain a gospel minister. It is possible the Lord may send one who as yet, knows not the gospel, to learn it from its gracious effects on Mr. Cadogan's people, and the same work may still be carried on by another hand. If He is pleased to keep them together in a spirit of union, love, and prayer--I shall entertain great hopes. A patient waiting upon the Lord in prayer has often done wonders; for He is able to do more than we can ask or think.
