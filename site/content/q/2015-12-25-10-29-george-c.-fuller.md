title: Qualifictions for Deacons

If all there is to being a deacon revolves around flowers and fruit baskets and the quick drop off and pick up of sermon tapes, these characteristics do not have special importance. But if indeed the deacon is going to meet people at their deep levels of need, if he is going to know people who hunger, thirst, who long for friend, who need help of all kinds, then he need special control of his tongue (and his ear) and special sensitivity with regard to money.
