I am daily forced to admire how lamentably ignorant many of our people are, that have seemed diligent hearers of me these 10 or 12 years, while I spoke as plainly as I was able to speak! Some know not that each person in the Trinity is God; or that Christ is God and man; nor that he took his human nature with him into heaven; nor many the like necessary principles of our faith.
