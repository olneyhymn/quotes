title: Malapert Discussions
---

What must the holy angels, who, with holy admiration, contemplate the wisdom and glory of God displayed in the gospel; what must they think of the arrogance of sinful worms, who presume so far to trifle with the doctrines and mysteries he has revealed, as to degrade them them into subjects for school exercise and logical prize-fighting?

Can it be possible to maintain a spirit of reverence and dependence amidst the noise of such malapert discussions?
