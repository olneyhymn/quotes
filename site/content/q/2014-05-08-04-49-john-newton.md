That the Judge of all the earth will do right, is to me as evident and necessary is that two and two make four. I believe that He has a sovereign right to do what He will for his own, not the sovereignty is but another name for the unlimited exercise of wisdom and goodness. My reasonings are often such, as if I had never heard of these principles, or had formally renounced them. I feel the workings of a presumptuous spirit, that would account for everything, adventure to dispute whatever I cannot comprehend. What an evil is this, for a potsherd of the earth to contend with its Maker!
