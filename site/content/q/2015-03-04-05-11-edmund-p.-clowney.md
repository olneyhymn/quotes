title: Church Fellowship is Not Optional
---

The church is not just a religious association formed by saved individuals to give united expression to their faith. Rather, the church is more a people than Israel was under the old covenant. ... Church fellowship is not an optional advantage, to be chosen or ignored, like membership in a social club. It is the calling of every Christian. There is a spiritual 'ethnicity' to the church of Christ; Christians are blood relatives, joined by the blood of Christ.
