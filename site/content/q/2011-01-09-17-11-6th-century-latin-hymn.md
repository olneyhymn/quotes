title: At the Lamb's high feast we sing
---

Where the paschal blood is poured, death's dark angel sheathes his sword;
Israel's host triumphant go though the wave that drowns the foe.
Praise we Christ, whose blood was shed, paschal victim paschal bread; with sincerity and love eat we manna from above.
