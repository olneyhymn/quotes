I find that many children become interested, even engrossed, in The Lord of the Rings, from about 10 onwards. I think this is rather a pity, really. It was not written for them. But then I am a very 'unvoracious' reader, and since I can seldom bring myself to really work twice I think of the many things I read – too soon! Nothing, not even a (possible) deeper appreciation, for me replaces the bloom on a book, the freshness of the unread.
