title: Christ is in None of These Ways
---
Some men rejoice in othersâ€™ failings; they are malicious and fail more in that sinful joy than their brethren in that which they rejoice at.

Some are angry at weaknesses and infirmities; they are proud and conceited, not considering that they themselves also are in the flesh.

Some delight to dwell always upon a frailty...

Some study revenge more than pardon.

Some pretend to forgive, concealing a rough heart behind a smooth face.

Christ is in none of these ways.
