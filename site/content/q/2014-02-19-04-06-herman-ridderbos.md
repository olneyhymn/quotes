For what is intended is not merely that Christ was the First or formed the beginning in terms of chronological order; he was rather the Pioneer, the Inaugurator, who opened up the way. With him the great Resurrection becomes reality. And very similar is the meaning of Firstborn from the dead: he ushers in the world of the resurrection.
