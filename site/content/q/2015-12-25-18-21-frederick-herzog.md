When during World War II the Netherlands were occupied by Germans the deacons of the Dutch Reformed Church assumed the care for the politically persecuted, supplying food and providing secret refuge. Realizing what was happening, the Germans decreed that the elective office of deacon should be eliminated. The Reformed Synod on 17 July 1941 resolved: 'Whoever touches the diaconate interferes with what Christ has ordained as the task of the church... Whoever lays hands on diakoma lays hands on worship!' The Germans backed down.
