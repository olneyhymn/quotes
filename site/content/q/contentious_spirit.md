Scripture often condemns a “contentious” spirit ([Prov. 13:10, 18:6, 26:21, Hab. 1:3, 1 Cor. 1:11, 11:16, Tit. 3:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Prov.+13%3A10%2C+18%3A6%2C+26%3A21%2C+Hab.+1%3A3%2C+1+Cor.+1%3A11%2C+11%3A16%2C+Tit.+3%3A9&version=NIV)) and commends “gentleness” ([2 Cor. 10:1, Gal. 5:22, 1 Thess. 2:7, 2 Tim. 2:24, Tit. 3:2, Jas. 3:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Cor.+10%3A1%2C+Gal.+5%3A22%2C+1+Thess.+2%3A7%2C+2+Tim.+2%3A24%2C+Tit.+3%3A2%2C+Jas.+3%3A17&version=NIV)). The Reformed community should give much more attention to these biblical themes.
