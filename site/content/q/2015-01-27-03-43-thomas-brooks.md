Remember, it is not a hasty reading, but serious meditating upon holy and heavenly truths, that make them prove sweet and profitable to the soul. It is not the bees touching of a flower that gathers honey, but her abiding for a time on the flower the draws all the sweetness. It is not he reads most, but he meditates most, that will prove the choicest, sweetest, wisest, and strongest Christian.
