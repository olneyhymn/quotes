title: Trifles Once Discouraging
---

The hour is coming when we shall be astonished to think what mere trifles were once capable of discouraging us for though many things we now meet with have a kind of importance respecting the present life and our natural feelings. 

Yet when we come to see things as they are, and get a clearer view of the difference between the temporary and the eternal—of the lightness of the one and the weight of the other—we shall be satisfied that there is a greater disproportion between them than between molehills and mountains and that when the Lord has put us in possession of the pearl of great price—the gain or loss of a pebble was hardly worth a serious thought.
