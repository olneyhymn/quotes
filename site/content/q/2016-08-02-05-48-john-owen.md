Meekness, patience, forbearance, and forgiveness, hiding, covering, removing of offensesâ€”these are the footsteps of Christ. 

Do you see your brother fail? Pity him. Does he continue in it? Earnestly pray for him and admonish him. 

If you are angry, vexed, rejoiced, alienated from him, then you are partner with him in evil, instead of helping him.
