On two occasions I have been asked, â€” 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' In one case a member of the Upper, and in the other a member of the Lower, House [of British Parliament] put this question. 

I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.
