title: Danny Hyde on the Lord\'s Day
---
All of this teaches us that instead of seeing the Lord's Day as a rule that stifles our 'weekend,' we need to view it as a gift from God that actually structures our lives. The practice of the Lord's Day is not legalism, but it is a part of our piety, providing us physical and spiritual rest. We sanctify the day because we belong not to this age that is passing away but to the glorious age to come.
