...make every effort to 
supplement your faith with virtue, 
and virtue with knowledge, 
and knowledge with self-control, 
and self-control with steadfastness, 
and steadfastness with godliness, 
and godliness with brotherly affection, 
and brotherly affection with love. ...

I intend always to remind you of these qualities, though you know them and are established in the truth that you have.
