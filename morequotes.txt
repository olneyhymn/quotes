3. "When the Scrooby Congregation separatists arrived in the Netherlands (prior to founding Plymouth Colony), they met another English congregation who had decided infant baptism was unscriptural. The pastor of that congregation 'determined that all of the adult members of his congregation (including himself) needed to be baptized as believers, but since all of the ministers of his acquaintance (including himself) had been originally ordained in a 'false' church, they lacked the authority to perform baptisms. In the face of this catch-22, the poor minister eventually baptized himself, before ultimately deciding that this, too, had been illegitimate.'" - Robert Tracy McKenzie

4. "King Henry the Fourth (of France) asked the Duke of Alva if he had observed the great eclipse of the sun, which had lately happened. No, said the duke, I have so much to do on earth, that I have no leisure to look up to heaven. All, that this were not true of most [professing Christians] in these days ! It is very sad to think, how their hearts and time is so much taken up with earthly things, that they have scarce any leisure to look up to heaven, or to look after Christ, and the things that belong to their everlasting peace." - Thomas Brooks, "Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices"

5. "For any mode of relating the water to a person that is attested in the various biblical water ordeals would have biblical warrant. Of course, not all such modes would prove expedient.

6. David Williams: "If you have ever been a part of a church plant, you have seen this guy." (and/or been that guy)

7. "Interesting article to show up in the New York Times. (1) 'Calvinism' is about so much more than Calvin or TULIP; this article misses that. (2) Mark Dever is a godly man and a powerful preacher. I thank God for http://www.capitolhillbaptist.org/audio/. (3) This quote: 'Liberal Christians, including some Congregationalists and liberal Presbyterians, may just take up other aspects of Calvin’s teachings, Dr. Jones said. She mentioned Calvin’s belief that 'civic engagement is the main form of obedience to God.' How about

a quote from Calvin: 'Surely the first foundation of righteousness is the worship of God.'" (http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.ix.html)

8. "Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food joint. You're much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession." (http://bit.ly/jKkNc5)

9. Barack Obama, libertarian? "...we shouldn’t have a bunch of politicians, a majority of whom are men, making health care decisions on behalf of women." (http://j.mp/O8N2tg)

13. Ron Paul (to Jay Leno), on why he has refused Secret Service protection: "It’s a form of welfare. You know, you’re having the taxpayers pay to take care of somebody and I’m an ordinary citizen and I would think I should pay for my own protection and it costs, I think, more than $50,000 a day to protect those individuals. It’s a lot of money." (http://j.mp/GDTZNe)

14. "Visitors of an academically demanding institution, then, may be more prone to enrolling in such an institution after visiting it on a cloudier day, since academic work would have seemed more inviting during their visit and hence been projected as more inviting into the future as well." (http://bit.ly/x26CbB)

15. "Law-gospel is a wonderful theological category. It’s lousy exegesis. If every command that you find you put in the category of law, and every promise you put in the category of gospel, and every time you see a command you say, ‘Well the point of this command must be, you can’t do this but Jesus has done it for you and therefore be thankful for the justification you have in him, you are absolutely eradicating scores of imperatives and exhortations that Paul treasures in the New Testament and things that are deeply important for us to embrace as Christians." - J. Ligon Duncan III (http://bit.ly/y4QVPt)

16. "The church is required to be the body of Christ in which the unmarried may find fulfillment as persons in the fellowship and companionship of the congregation of believers. The church should recognize that being unmarried the single members are free to be 'anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord' (1 Corinthians 7:32). Therefore they must be given the opportunity within the fellowship of believers to serve the body of Christ and experience the love and acceptance of the body of the Lord." -

Christian Reformed Church, Report 42, 1970

17. "Ron Paul believes no nation can remain free when the state has greater influence over the knowledge and values transmitted to children than the family does. And the truth is, no big government spending program can or will solve our nation’s education problems. One-size-fits-all central planning simply does not work." (http://j.mp/txNrfC)

18. "I find that when someone's taking time to do something right in the present, they're a perfectionist with no ability to prioritize, whereas when someone took time to do something right in the past, they're a master artisan of great foresight." - Anon. (http://xkcd.com/974/)

19. "If man is not to do more harm than good in his efforts to improve the social order, he will have to learn that in this, as in all other fields where essential complexity of an organized kind prevails, he cannot acquire the full knowledge which would make mastery of the events possible." - Friedrich August von Hayek, Nobel Prize Lecture (http://bit.ly/pwtCeY)

20. "If Borders were a government agency, its budget would have been fattened up during the past few years, and it’d survive in perpetuity, whatever its merits." - Rich Lowry (http://bit.ly/naVA2O)

21. "Evangelical theology faces tough times ahead: the church seems variously determined to prioritise management technique, religious experience, or that nebulous bane of contemporary life, ‘relevance’, over any notion of careful reflection upon and articulation of its irreducibly doctrinal message and experience." - Carl Trueman (http://j.mp/iM9COL)

22. "I think today [Christians are] known simply as the people who hate abortion and hate homosexuals. Someday maybe we'll be known as the people who love to eat together." - Ken Myers (http://j.mp/mrOhqd)

23. "Promises are made, and this sacrament is appointed, for the relief even of weak and doubting Christians." - WLC 172 (http://www.opc.org/lc.html)
