The Reformed community should give much more attention to these biblical themes." (John Frame)</div>




 <div class="comment">This is James Barron Hopper. We are thankful to have seen his strong heart and four limbs this afternoon. He's due August 9.

(My great grandmother Hopper was born Annis Barron to the Barrons of Rock Hill, South Carolina and the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. The Barrons are descended from James Barron, an Edinburgh magistrate and a commissioner to the first General Assembly of the Scotland alongside John Knox.)</div>




 <div class="comment">When the Scrooby Congregation separatists arrived in the Netherlands (prior to founding Plymouth Colony), they met another English congregation who had decided infant baptism was unscriptural. The pastor of that congregation

"determined that all of the adult members of his congregation (including himself) needed to be baptized as believers, but since all of the ministers of his acquaintance (including himself) had been originally ordained in a 'false' church, they lacked the authority to perform baptisms. In the face of this catch-22, the poor minister eventually baptized himself, before ultimately deciding that this, too, had been illegitimate." (Robert Tracy McKenzie)</div>




 <div class="comment">"It is folly to complain of the badness of our own times when we have more reason to complain of the badness of our own hearts (if men’s hearts were better, the times would mend) and when we have more reason to be thankful that they are not worse, but that even in the worst of times we enjoy many mercies, which help to make them not only tolerable, but comfortable." (Matthew Henry)</div>




 <div class="comment">"King Henry the Fourth (of France) asked the Duke of Alva if he had observed the great eclipse of the sun, which had lately happened. No, said the duke, I have so much to do on earth, that I have no leisure to look up to heaven. All, that this were not true of most [professing Christians] in these days ! It is very sad to think, how their hearts and time is so much taken up with earthly things, that they have scarce any leisure to look up to heaven, or to look after Christ, and the things that belong to their everlasting peace." (Thomas Brooks, Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices)</div>




 <div class="comment">"For any mode of relating the water to a person that is attested in the various biblical water ordeals would have biblical warrant. Of course, not all such modes would prove expedient. In Israel's passage through the Red Sea the baptismal waters stood in a threatening (if actually protective) position over against the Israelites without, however, touching them, while in the Jordan crossing, the waters were so far removed as to be quite out of sight. At the other extreme, Jonah, like the accused in the Babylonian water ordeal, was plunged into the depths (not to mention now his novel conveyance), and the baptized family in the Noahic deluge ordeal sailed over the rising flood while torrents descended from above." (Meredith Kline, By Oath Consigned)</div>

 <div class="comment">Interesting article to show up in the New York Times.

(1) "Calvinism" is about so much more than Calvin or TULIP; this article misses that.
(2) Mark Dever is a godly man and a powerful preacher. I thank God for http://www.capitolhillbaptist.org/audio/.
(3) This quote: "Liberal Christians, including some Congregationalists and liberal Presbyterians, may just take up other aspects of Calvin’s teachings, Dr. Jones said. She mentioned Calvin’s belief that 'civic engagement is the main form of obedience to God.'" How about a quote from Calvin: "Surely the first foundation of righteousness is the worship of God."

 <div class="comment">"Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food joint. You're much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession." (http://bit.ly/jKkNc5)</div>




 <div class="comment">Barack Obama, libertarian?

"...we shouldn’t have a bunch of politicians, a majority of whom are men, making health care decisions on behalf of women." (http://j.mp/O8N2tg)</div>




 <div class="comment">"There aren't many books being written about the seven steps to living quiet, peaceful, and godly lives, and yet that's the explicit, unequivocal teaching of the word of God."  (Dr. R. Scott Clark, http://j.mp/MeqjIW)</div>




 <div class="comment">"When I ask students who are the most influential pastors in their life, it’s concerning that they rarely mention their local pastors." (Carl Trueman, http://j.mp/HW4HCk)</div>




 <div class="comment">"I read [the 740 page N.T. Wright book on the Resurrection of Jesus] while brushing my teeth over a period of time. ... One page in the morning, one in the evening." (Greg Beale, http://j.mp/I03Yhw)</div>




 <div class="comment">Ron Paul (to Jay Leno), on why he has refused Secret Service protection:

"It’s a form of welfare. You know, you’re having the taxpayers pay to take care of somebody and I’m an ordinary citizen and I would think I should pay for my own protection and it costs, I think, more than $50,000 a day to protect those individuals. It’s a lot of money." (http://j.mp/GDTZNe)</div>




 <div class="comment">"Visitors of an academically demanding institution, then, may be more prone to enrolling in such an institution after visiting it on a cloudier day, since academic work would have seemed more inviting during their visit and hence been projected as more inviting into the future as well." (http://bit.ly/x26CbB)</div>




 <div class="comment">"Law-gospel is a wonderful theological category. It’s lousy exegesis. If every command that you find you put in the category of law, and every promise you put in the category of gospel, and every time you see a command you say, ‘Well the point of this command must be, you can’t do this but Jesus has done it for you and therefore be thankful for the justification you have in him, you are absolutely eradicating scores of imperatives and exhortations that Paul treasures in the New Testament and things that are deeply important for us to embrace as Christians." (J. Ligon Duncan III, http://bit.ly/y4QVPt)</div>




 <div class="comment">"The church is required to be the body of Christ in which the unmarried may find fulfillment as persons in the fellowship and companionship of the congregation of believers. The church should recognize that being unmarried the single members are free to be 'anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord' (1 Corinthians 7:32). Therefore they must be given the opportunity within the fellowship of believers to serve the body of Christ and experience the love and acceptance of the body of the Lord." (Christian Reformed Church, Report 42, 1970)</div>




 <div class="comment">"Ron Paul believes no nation can remain free when the state has greater influence over the knowledge and values transmitted to children than the family does. And the truth is, no big government spending program can or will solve our nation’s education problems. One-size-fits-all central planning simply does not work." (http://j.mp/txNrfC)</div>




 <div class="comment">"I find that when someone's taking time to do something right in the present, they're a perfectionist with no ability to prioritize, whereas when someone took time to do something right in the past, they're a master artisan of great foresight." (Anon., http://xkcd.com/974/)</div>




 <div class="comment">"If man is not to do more harm than good in his efforts to improve the social order, he will have to learn that in this, as in all other fields where essential complexity of an organized kind prevails, he cannot acquire the full knowledge which would make mastery of the events possible." (Friedrich August von Hayek, Nobel Prize Lecture http://bit.ly/pwtCeY)</div>




 <div class="comment">"If Borders were a government agency, its budget would have been fattened up during the past few years, and it’d survive in perpetuity, whatever its merits." (Rich Lowry, http://bit.ly/naVA2O)</div>




 <div class="comment">"Evangelical theology faces tough times ahead: the church seems variously determined to prioritise management technique, religious experience, or that nebulous bane of contemporary life, ‘relevance’, over any notion of careful reflection upon and articulation of its irreducibly doctrinal message and experience." (Carl Trueman, http://j.mp/iM9COL)</div>




 <div class="comment">"I think today [Christians are] known simply as the people who hate abortion and hate homosexuals. Someday maybe we'll be known as the people who love to eat together." (Ken Myers, http://j.mp/mrOhqd)</div>




 <div class="comment">"Promises are made, and this sacrament is appointed, for the relief even of weak and doubting Christians." (WLC 172, http://www.opc.org/lc.html)</div>




 <div class="comment">"I have no confidence in 'Christian culture.' I have confidence in Christ reigning through the gospel." (Rick Phillips, http://reformedforum.org/ctc169/)</div>
